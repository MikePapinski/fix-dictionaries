# Dukascopy FIX Dictionary

For professional market participants Dukascopy Bank offers the possibility of API integration. The Dukascopy Bank API is based on FIX4.4 protocol. The API is used to receive real-time data feed, submit orders, set / modify / cancel orders, and receive automated notifications of trading activities.

With a FIX API connection, users will still be able to use the standard Dukascopy Bank trading platforms with its basic functionality. However, the position calculation method (net/global position mode) applied to FIX API accounts is different.
